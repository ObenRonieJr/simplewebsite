<h2> Welcome to the Life of Motivation!</h2>

<p>Success is not final; failure is not fetal:It is the courage to continue that counts.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy looking for it.
Develop success from failures.Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.</p>
